# Elevate E-commerce

Welcome to the Elevate E-commerce project! This is a simple e-commerce website displaying products fetched from an API. The project is built with React and leverages custom hooks for fetching data, dynamic product rendering, and an elegant UI with reusable components.

## Features

- **Reusable Components**: Uses modular components like `NavBar`, `Slider`, `Card`, and `Footer` to maintain a clean code structure.
- **Error Handling**: Displays a loading screen while fetching data and handles errors gracefully.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive and optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
